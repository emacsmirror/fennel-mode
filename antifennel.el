;;; Commentary:

;; Turn Lua code into Fennel code from Emacs.
;; Requires install of antifennel: https://git.sr.ht/~technomancy/antifennel

;; Recommended usage:

;; (add-hook 'lua-mode-hook 'antifennel-mode)

;; This will make it so that C-c C-f in a lua-mode buffer will display
;; the Fennel equivalent. You can also invoke it with M-x antifennel-buffer.
